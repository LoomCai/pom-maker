# Shortcut entries in this file follow the form:
#   'shortcut command' = 'full command'
# Once a shortcut command is found, the corresponding full command is
# substituted and matching stops.  Shortcuts are evaluated top to bottom.
# Currently, shortcuts are only shown after the user types 'aws' as the first
# command and the user is currently inputting the subcommand:
#   aws [show shortcut matches]
# Shortcuts optionally support fuzzy completion.

#   aws emrls
'emr ls --cluster-states' = 'emr list-clusters --cluster-states'

# The following entries are placed here solely for easy fuzzy autocompletion
# For example: the following commands will kick off fuzzy auto-completion:
