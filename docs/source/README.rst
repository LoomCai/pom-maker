Motivation
----------

AWS CLI
~~~~~~~

Although the `AWS CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli>`__ is a great
resource to manage your AWS-powered services, it's **tough to remember
usage** of:

-  70+ top-level commands
-  2000+ subcommands
-  Countless command-specific options
-  Resources such as instance tags and buckets

SAWS: A Supercharged AWS CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SAWS`` aims to **supercharge** the AWS CLI with features focusing on:

-  **Improving ease-of-use**
-  **Increasing productivity**

Under the hood, ``SAWS`` is **powered by the AWS CLI** and supports the
**same commands** and **command structure**.

``SAWS`` and ``AWS CLI`` Usage:

::

    aws <command> <subcommand> [parameters] [options]

``SAWS`` features:

-  Auto-completion of:

   -  Commands
   -  Subcommands
   -  Options

-  Auto-completion of resources:

   -  Bucket names
   -  Instance ids
   -  Instance tags
   -  `More coming soon! <#todo-add-more-resources>`__

-  Customizable shortcuts
-  Fuzzy completion of resources and shortcuts
-  Fish-style auto-suggestions
-  Syntax and output highlighting
-  Execution of shell commands
-  Command history
-  Contextual help
-  Toolbar options

``SAWS`` is available for Mac, Linux, Unix, and
`Windows <#windows-support>`__.

Syntax and Output Highlighting
------------------------------

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/xQDpw70.png
   :alt: 

You can control which theme to load for syntax highlighting by updating
your
`~/.sawsrc <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/blob/master/saws/sawsrc>`__
file:

::

    # Visual theme. Possible values: manni, igor, xcode, vim, autumn, vs, rrt,
    # native, perldoc, borland, tango, emacs, friendly, monokai, paraiso-dark,
    # colorful, murphy, bw, pastie, paraiso-light, trac, default, fruity
    theme = vim

Auto-Completion of Commands, Subcommands, and Options
-----------------------------------------------------

``SAWS`` provides smart autocompletion as you type. Entering the
following command will interactively list and auto-complete all
subcommands **specific only** to ``ec2``:

::

    aws ec2

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/P2tL9vW.png
   :alt: 

Auto-Completion of AWS Resources
--------------------------------

In addition to the default commands, subcommands, and options the AWS
CLI provides, ``SAWS`` supports auto-completion of your AWS resources.
Currently, bucket names, instance ids, and instance tags are included,
with additional support for more resources `under
development <#todo-add-more-resources>`__.

S3 Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~

Option for ``s3api``:

::

    --bucket

Sample Usage:

::

    aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket

Syntax for ``s3``:

::

    s3://

Sample Usage:

::

    aws s3 ls s3://

Note: The example below demonstrates the use of `fuzzy resource
completion <fuzzy-resource-and-shortcutcompletion>`__:

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/39CAS5T.png
   :alt: 

EC2 Instance Ids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Option for ``ec2``:

::

    --instance-ids

Sample Usage:

::

    aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids
    aws ec2 ls --instance-ids

Note: The ``ls`` command demonstrates the use of `customizable
shortcuts <#customizable-shortcuts>`__:

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/jFyCSXl.png
   :alt: 

EC2 Instance Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Option for ``ec2``:

::

    --ec2-tag-key
    --ec2-tag-value

Sample Usage:

::

    aws ec2 ls --ec2-tag-key
    aws ec2 ls --ec2-tag-value

**Tags support wildcards** with the ``*`` character.

Note: ``ls``, ``--ec2-tag-value``, and ``--ec2-tag-key`` demonstrate the
use of `customizable shortcuts <#customizable-shortcuts>`__:

   :alt: 

TODO: Add More Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Feel free to `submit an issue or a pull request <#contributions>`__ if
you'd like support for additional resources.

Customizable Shortcuts
----------------------

The
`~/.saws.shortcuts <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/blob/master/saws/saws.shortcuts>`__
file contains shortcuts that you can modify. It comes pre-populated with
several `handy
shortcuts <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/blob/master/saws/saws.shortcuts>`__
out of the box. You can combine shortcuts with `fuzzy
completion <#fuzzy-resource-and-shortcut-completion>`__ for even less
keystrokes. Below are a few examples.

List all EC2 instances:

::

    aws ec2 ls

List all running EC2 instances:

::

    aws ec2 ls --ec2-state running  # fuzzy shortcut: aws ecstate

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/jYFEsoM.png
   :alt: 

List all EC2 instances with a matching tag (supports wildcards ``*``):

::

    aws ec2 ls --ec2-tag-key    # fuzzy shortcut: aws ectagk
    aws ec2 ls --ec2-tag-value  # fuzzy shortcut: aws ectagv

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/PSuwUIw.png
   :alt: 

List EC2 instance with matching id:

::

    aws ec2 ls --instance-ids  # fuzzy shortcut: aws eclsi

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/wGcUCsa.png
   :alt: 

List all DynamoDB tables:

::

    aws dynamodb ls  # fuzzy shortcut: aws dls

List all EMR clusters:

::

    aws emr ls  # fuzzy shortcut: aws emls

Add/remove/modify shortcuts in your
`~/.saws.shortcuts <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/blob/master/saws/shortcuts>`__
file to suit your needs.

Feel free to submit:

-  An issue to request additional shortcuts
-  A pull request if you'd like to share your shortcuts (see
   `contributing guidelines <#contributions>`__)

Fuzzy Resource and Shortcut Completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To toggle fuzzy completion of AWS resources and shortcuts, use ``F3``
key.

Sample fuzzy shortcuts to start and stop EC2 instances:

::

    aws ecstop
    aws ecstart

Note: Fuzzy completion currently only works with AWS
`resources <#auto-completion-of-aws-resources>`__ and
`shortcuts <customizable-shortcuts>`__.

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/7OvFHCw.png
   :alt: 

Fish-Style Auto-Suggestions
---------------------------

``SAWS`` supports Fish-style auto-suggestions. Use the ``right arrow``
key to complete a suggestion.

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/t5200q1.png
   :alt: 

Executing Shell Commands
------------------------

``SAWS`` allows you to execute shell commands from the ``saws>`` prompt.

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/FiSn6b2.png
   :alt: 

Command History
---------------

``SAWS`` keeps track of commands you enter and stores them in
``~/.saws-history``. Use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through the
command history.

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/z8RrDQB.png
   :alt: 

Contextual Help
---------------

``SAWS`` supports contextual command line ``help`` and contextual web
``docs``.

Contextual Command Line Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``help`` command is powered by the AWS CLI and outputs help within
the command line.

Usage:

::

    aws <command> <subcommand> help

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/zSkzt6y.png
   :alt: 

Contextual Web Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you're not quite sure what specific command/subcommand/option
combination you need to use. In such cases, browsing through several
combinations with the ``help`` command line is cumbersome versus
browsing the online AWS CLI docs through a web browser.

``SAWS`` supports contextual web docs with the ``docs`` command or the
``F9`` key. ``SAWS`` will display the web docs specific to the currently
entered command and subcommand.

Usage:

::

    aws <command> <subcommand> docs

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/zK4IJYp.png
   :alt: 

Toolbar Options
---------------

``SAWS`` supports a number of toolbar options:

-  ``F2`` toggles `output syntax
   highlighting <#syntax-and-output-highlighting>`__
-  ``F3`` toggles `fuzzy completion of AWS resources and
   shortcuts <#fuzzy-resource-and-shortcut-completion>`__
-  ``F4`` toggles `completion of shortcuts <#customizable-shortcuts>`__
-  ``F5`` refreshes `resources for
   auto-completion <#auto-completion-of-aws-resources>`__
-  ``F9`` displays the `contextual web docs <#contextual-web-docs>`__
-  ``F10`` or ``control d`` exits ``SAWS``

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/7vz8OSc.png
   :alt: 

Windows Support
---------------

``SAWS`` has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10.

On Windows, the
`.sawsrc <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/blob/master/saws/sawsrc>`__
file can be found in ``%userprofile%``. For example:

::

    C:\Users\dmartin\.sawsrc

Although you can use the standard Windows command prompt, you'll
probably have a better experience with either
`cmder <https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder>`__ or
`conemu <https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu>`__.

Installation
------------

Pip Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|PyPI version| |PyPI|

``SAWS`` is hosted on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/saws>`__. The
following command will install ``SAWS`` along with dependencies such as
the `AWS CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli>`__:

::

    $ pip install saws

You can also install the latest ``SAWS`` from GitHub source which can
contain changes not yet pushed to PyPI:

::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/donnemartin/saws.git

If you are not installing in a
`virtualenv <#virtual-environment-and-docker-installation>`__, run with
``sudo``:

::

    $ sudo pip install saws

Once installed, start ``SAWS``:

::

    $ saws

Virtual Environment and Docker Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended that you install Python packages in a
`virtualenv <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__
to avoid potential `issues with dependencies or
permissions <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/issues/15>`__.

To view ``SAWS`` ``virtualenv`` and `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__
installation instructions, click
`here <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md>`__.

Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a known issue with Apple and its included python package
dependencies (more info at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165). We
are investigating ways to fix this issue but in the meantime, to install
saws, you can run:

::

    $ sudo pip install saws --upgrade --ignore-installed six

AWS Credentials and Named Profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Configure your
credentials <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli#getting-started>`__ with the
AWS CLI:

::

    $ aws configure

If you'd like to use a specific named profile with ``SAWS``, run the
following commands on OS X, Linux, or Unix:

::

    $ export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=user1
    $ saws

Or as a one-liner:

::

    $ AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=user1 saws

Windows users can run the following commands:

::

    > set AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=user1
    > saws

Command line options for starting ``SAWS`` with a specific profile are
`under development <https://github.com/donnemartin/saws/issues/16>`__.
For more details on how to install and configure the AWS CLI, refer to
the following
`documentation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html>`__.
