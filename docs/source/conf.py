# -- General configuration ------------------------------------------------

# If your documentation needs a minimal Sphinx version, state it here.

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:
# source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']

# The encoding of source files.

# The master toctree document.

# |version| and |release|, also used in various other places throughout the
# built documents.
#
# The short X.Y version.
version = '0.1.0'
# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
release = '0.1.0'

# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.
#
# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.
language = None

# There are two options for replacing |today|: either, you set today to some
# non-false value, then it is used:
#today = ''
# Else, today_fmt is used as the format for a strftime call.
#today_fmt = '%B %d, %Y'
